About Me
I’m Mohammad Qazim Bhat, a graduate student at University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in Computer Vision, Foundation Models, and Multi-Modal LLMs. My research bridges vision-language understanding, real-time robotic applications, and efficient data curation for large AI models.

Research Interests
Vision-Language Models: Building systems for robotic manipulation and autonomous applications.
Foundation Models: Developing robust, scalable multi-modal LLMs.
Data Curation: Crafting pipelines and distillation techniques to optimize model training.
Experience & Contributions
I've worked on pioneering projects at MBZUAI (vision-language models) and Correll Lab (robotics-focused multi-modal models). My industry experience includes data science at ITC Limited and machine learning at Samsung R&D.

Publications & Open Source
I’ve published in venues like NeurIPS, IJCV, and IJCAI and contributed to popular open-source projects like AutoVideo and TODS (25k+ GitHub stars), making advanced AI techniques widely accessible.

Goals
I aim to advance practical AI applications, particularly in robotic systems and scalable multi-modal models. I welcome collaboration in computer vision, robotics, and AI.
